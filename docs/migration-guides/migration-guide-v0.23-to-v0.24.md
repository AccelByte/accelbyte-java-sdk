## [v0.24.0] - 2022-11-21

### BREAKING CHANGE

Following changes in AB Gaming Services OpenAPI spec:

- Model `TrackedEntitlementInfo` is replaced with `EntitlementDecrementResult`

The new model(s) above are compatible with the models it is replacing. So, if you are affected, a simple rename should be sufficient e.g. rename `TrackedEntitlementInfo` with `EntitlementDecrementResult` in your code.
